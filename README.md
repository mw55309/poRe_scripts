Linux command line scripts to be used with poRe

Directory old_format refers to FAST5 format used before mid November 2015

Directory new_format refers to FAST5 format used after mid November 2015

All scripts take a single argument - the path to a directory containing FAST5 files

All scripts spit out FASTQ to STDOUT and a brief message to STDERR

Script names are self-explanatory ;-)
